## Overview

Backlogs will be managed at various level in Agile. Based on the Product Roadmap, the intial set of requirements will be grouped and then planned for release There are four levels of planning in Agile. These include:
-	Roadmap
-	Release Planning
-	Sprint Planning.

From the Product Roadmap, arrive at Initial Set of High-priority Requirements
- Product Roadmap -> Requirements -> Releases -> Sprints
- Requirements -> Logical Groups

Decompose Requirements into: (level of detailing depends on early product definition)
- Themes: logical grouping of features into Themes (Requirements at the
highest level, e.g., Account Info, Transactions, Support functions,…)
- Features: describe capability of the Product (part of the Product, e.g, view balance, pay bills, reset password, transfer money,…)
- Epic User Stories: large set of Requirements that support a Feature containing multiple actions
- User Stories: containing single action enough to start implementing (~use-cases, scenarios)
- Tasks: execution steps required to develop a story; breakdown User Story into Tasks during Sprint planning


## Backlog should be DEEP

DETAILED
The backlog should be detailed enough so that everyone understands the need (not just the person who wrote it).

ESTIMATED
The user story should be sufficient for the delivery team to provide an estimated effort for implementing it. (Stories near the top of the product backlog can be estimated more accurately
than those near the bottom.)

EMERGENT
The product backlog should contain those stories that are considered emergent—reflecting current, pressing, or realistic needs.

PRIORITIZED
The product backlog should be prioritized so everyone understands which stories are most important now and require implementation soon
