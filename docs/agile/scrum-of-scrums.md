## Overview

Scrum of scrums is a technique used to scale Scrum to a larger group (over a dozen people) working towards the same project goal. In Scrum, consider a team being too big when going over 10-12 individuals. This should be decided on a case by case basis. 

The goal of the scrum of scrums ceremony is to give sub-teams the agility they need while not loosing visibility and coordination. It also helps to ensure that the sub-teams are achieving their sprint goals, and they are going in the right direction to achieve the overall project goal.


- The Scrum of Scrums proceeds otherwise as a normal daily meeting, with ambassadors reporting completions, next steps and impediments on behalf of the teams they represent. 
- Resolution of impediments is expected to focus on the challenges of coordination between the teams; solutions may entail agreeing to interfaces between teams, negotiating responsibility boundaries, etc.
- The Scrum of Scrum will track these items via a backlog of its own, where each item
contributes to improving between-team coordination.

## Participants
Each daily scrum within a sub-team ends by designating one member as "ambassador" to participate in a daily meeting with ambassadors from other teams.

## Outcomes
- Dependency tracing across teams is easier
- Lower the risk of integration issues ands increases the project chance of succes.
- Resolutions to the impedients will be faster
- Tracking the time to resolve issues in the scrum of scrums backlog.
