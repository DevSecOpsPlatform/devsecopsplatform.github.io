## Overview
Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. Continuous integration most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process and entails both an automation component (e.g. a CI or build service) and a cultural component (e.g. learning to integrate frequently). The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

## Benefits of Continuous Integration
- Improve Developer Productivity - Continuous integration helps team be more productive by freeing developers from manual tasks and encouraging behaviors that help reduce the number of errors and bugs released to customers.
- Find and Address Bugs Quicker - With more frequent testing, team can discover and address bugs earlier before they grow into larger problems later.
- Deliver Updates Faster - Continuous integration helps team deliver updates to their customers faster and more frequently.
